# impsorter

You might think the structure of your imports are important (*no pun intended*). This is an extension to help you sort your import statement in an easy convenient way.

## Features

### How to use
`vs-impsorter-extension` supports a number of commands for sorting import statements; these are acessible via the command menu `(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)` and may be bound to keyboard shortcuts in the normal way.

### Sort imports on one line selection
